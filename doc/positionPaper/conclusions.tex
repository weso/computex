\section{Conclusions}

Using SPARQL queries to validate and compute index data seems a promising use
case for linked data applications. 
Although we have successfully employed this approach to validate most of the
statistical computations we needed for the WebIndex project, we have found some
limitations in current SPARQL 1.1 expressivity with regards to built-in
functions on maths, strings and RDF Collections.

We consider that our approach may be of interest to the RDF Validation 
 workshop in 2 ways: firstly as a practical approach to validate RDF data
 which poses some expressivity challenges, and secondly, as a 
 use case with real data than can act as a benchmark to compare different
 validation strategies.

Our future work is to automate the declarative computation of index data
 from the raw observations and to check the performance using
 the Web Index data. 
We are also studying the feasibility of this approach 
 for online calculation of index scores and rankings.
