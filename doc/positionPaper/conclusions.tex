\section{Conclusions}

Using SPARQL queries to validate and compute index data seems a promising use
case for linked data applications. 
Although we have succesfully employed this approach to validate most of the
statistical computations we needed for the WebIndex project, we have found some
limitations in current SPARQL 1.1 expressivity.

Our future work is to automate the declarative computation of index data
 from the raw observations and to check the performance with real data like
 the Web Index data. We are also considering the feasibility of this approach 
 for online calculation of index scores and rankings.
