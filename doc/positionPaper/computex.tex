\section{Example data and Index computation process}

Our data model consists of a list of observations which can be raw observations
obtained from an external source or computed observations derived from other
observations. An example observation could be declared as:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=SPARQL]
obs:obsM23 a qb:Observation ;
 cex:computation [ a cex:Z-Score ; 
      cex:observation obs:obsA23 ; cex:slice slice:sliceA09 ; ] ;
 cex:value 0.56 ;
 cex:md5-checksum "2917835203..." ;
 cex:indicator indicator:A ;
 cex:concept country:ESP ;
 qb:dataSet dataset:A-Normalized ;
 # ... other declarations omitted for brevity
\end{lstlisting}

Where we declare that the \lstinline|obs:obsM23| is an observation
 whose value is \lstinline|0.56| that has been obtained as the Z-Score
 of the observation \lstinline|obs:A23| using the slice
 \lstinline|slice:sliceA09|. The observations refers to indicator
 \lstinline|indicator:A|, to the concept \lstinline|country:ESP| and to the
 dataset \lstinline|dataset:A-Normalized|.
 
For each observation, we also add a value for 
\lstinline|cex:md5-checksum| which is a obtained as a combination of the 
different values of the observation and allows a user to verify the
values declared by that observation.


\section{Data Model and Computex Ontology}

\subsection{Computex Ontology}
The \emph{Computex} vocabulary is available
at~\url{http://purl.org/weso/computex}. It defines terms related to the
computation of statistical index data and is an specialization of
the RDF Data Cube vocabulary. The main list of terms employed in the vocabulary
are:

\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{Concept}. The concept that we are indexing. In the case of the Web
Index project, the concepts are the different countries. In other domains, it
could be Universities, journals, services, etc.

\item\textbf{Indicator}. A dimension that can add information to the Index
computation. Indicators can be simple dimensions, for example: the mobile phone
suscriptions per 100 population, or can be aggregated values from other
indicators. 

\item\textbf{Observation}. This term is compatible with the
RDF Data Cube \lstinline|qb:Observation|. It contains values for the
properties: \lstinline|cex:value|, 
   \lstinline|cex:indicator| and 
   \lstinline|cex:concept|, etc. The value of the observation can be a Raw value
   obtained from an external source or a computed value obtained from other
   observations.

\item\textbf{Computation}. We have declared the main computation types that we
have needed for the WebIndex project, which have been summarized in
table~\ref{table:computations}. That list of computation types is not exhaustive
and can be further extended in the future. 

\item\textbf{WeightSchema} a weight schema for a list of indicators. It consists
of a weight associated for each indicator which can be used to compute an
aggregated observation.

\end{itemize}

\section{Validation approach}

The validation approach was inspired by the integrity constraint specification
 proposed by the RDF Data Cube vocabulary which employs a set of SPARQL ASK queries
 to check the integrity of RDF Data Cube data. 
 Although SPARQL ASK queries provide a good means to check the integrity, in practice
  their boolean nature does not offer too much help when a file does not validate.
 To solve that issue, we defined CONSTRUCT queries which, in case of error, 
  construct an error message and a list of error parameters that can help to spot the
  problematic data.

 We have also transformed the ASK queries defined in the RDF Data Cube
 vocabulary to CONSTRUCT queries. For example, SPARQL construct query to validate the RDF Data Cube integrity
 constraint 4 (IC-4) is:
 
\begin{lstlisting}[style=SPARQL]
CONSTRUCT {
 [ a cex:Error ; cex:errorParam [cex:name "dim"; cex:value ?dim ] ;
   cex:msg "Every Dimension must have a declared range" . ]
} WHERE { ?dim a qb:DimensionProperty .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?dim rdfs:range [] }
}
\end{lstlisting}
 
In order to make our error messages compatible with EARL~\cite{EARL}, we have
 defined \lstinline|cex:Error| as a subclass of \lstinline|earl:TestResult| and 
 declared it to have the value \lstinline|earl:failed| for the property
 \lstinline|earl:outcome|.
 
We have also created our own set of SPARQL Construct queries to validate the
 \emph{Computex} vocabulary terms, specially the computation of index data.
For example, the following query validates that every observation 
  has at most one value.
 
\begin{lstlisting}[style=SPARQL]
CONSTRUCT {
 [ a cex:Error ; cex:errorParam  # ... omitted 
    cex:msg "Observation has two different values" . ]
} WHERE { ?obs a qb:Observation . 
 ?obs cex:value ?value1 . ?obs cex:value ?value2 .
 FILTER ( ?value1 != ?value2  )
}
\end{lstlisting}

Using this approach, it is possible to define more expressive validations.
For example, we were able to validate that an observation was obtained as the
mean of other observations. 

\begin{lstlisting}[style=SPARQL]
CONSTRUCT {
 [ a cex:Error ; cex:errorParam # ...omitted 
   cex:msg "Mean value does not match" ] . 
} WHERE { 
    ?obs a qb:Observation ;
         cex:computation ?comp ;
         cex:value ?val .
  ?comp a cex:Mean .
  { SELECT (AVG(?value) as ?mean) ?comp WHERE {
     ?comp cex:observation ?obs1 .
	 ?obs1 cex:value ?value ;
  } GROUP BY ?comp } 
 FILTER( abs(?mean - ?val) > 0.0001)
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Expressivity limits of SPARQL queries}

Validating statistical computations using SPARQL queries offered 
 a good exercise to check SPARQL expressivity. Although we were able 
 to express most of the computation types. 
Some of them had to employ functions that are not part of the SPARQL 1.1
standard or had to be defined in a limited way. In this section we review 
the main difficulties.

\begin{itemize} 

\item The Z-score of a value $x_i$ is defined as $\frac{x - \bar{x}}{\sigma}$
where $\bar{x}$ is the mean and $\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(\bar{x}-x_i)^2}{N -
1}}$ is the standard deviation. To validate that computation using SPARQL
queries, it is necessary to employ the \lstinline|sqrt| function. 
This function is not available in SPARQL 1.1 although some implementations 
 like Jena
 ARQ\footnoteUrl{http://jena.apache.org/documentation/query/library-function.html} 
 provide it.

\item In order to validate the ranking of an observation (in which position it
appears in a Slice), we used the \lstinline|GROUP_CONCAT| SPARQL 1.1
function to group the ordered list of observations. However, SPARQL 
 does not offer a function to calculate the position of a substring in a
 string\footnote{This function is called \lstinline|strpos|
 in PHP or \lstinline|indexOf| in Java}, so in order to search the concept to
 rank, we had to divide the length of the substring before 
 the concept's name by the length of the concept's
 name. This solution only works when all the concept's name have the same
 length.

\item Given a list of values $x_1,x_2\ldots{}x_n$ the expected value
$x_{n+1}$ can be extrapolated using the forward average growth formula: 
$x_n\times{\frac{\frac{x_{n}}{x_{n-1}}+\ldots{}+\frac{x_{2}}{x_1}}{n-1}}$. 

If we represent the list of observations as an RDF collection, we were unable to
define a SPARQL query that can express that formula for any length $n$.
Instead, we were able to express that formula for a fixed length using SPARQL
1.1 property path expressions. 

\begin{lstlisting}[style=SPARQL]
CONSTRUCT {
 [ a cex:Error ; cex:errorParam # ...omitted
   cex:msg "Average growth value does not match" ] .
} WHERE { 
  ?obs cex:computation [ a cex:AverageGrowth3 ;
	                     cex:observations ?ls ;] ;
   cex:value ?val .
 ?ls rdf:first ?x1 .
 ?ls rdf:rest/rdf:first ?x2 .
 ?ls rdf:rest/rdf:rest/rdf:first ?x3 .
 ?x1 cex:value ?v1 . ?x2 cex:value ?v2 . ?x3 cex:value ?v3 .
 BIND ((?v1 * ((?v1 / ?v2) + (?v2 / ?v3)) / 2) as ?avgGrowth)
 FILTER (abs(?avgGrowth - ?val) > 0.001)
}
\end{lstlisting}

\end{itemize}
