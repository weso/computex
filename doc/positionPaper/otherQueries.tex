\subsection{Ranking}
Suppose I have the following triples:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=SPARQL]
:A :value 60 .
:B :value 23 .
:C :value 89 .
:D :value 34 .
\end{lstlisting}

and I want to obtain a ranking where C would be 1, A 2, D 3 and B 4.

The ranking can be obtained as:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=SPARQL]
SELECT ?x ?v ?ranking { 
 ?x :value ?v .
 { SELECT (GROUP_CONCAT(?x;separator="") as ?ordered) {
    { SELECT ?x {
       ?x :value ?v .
      } ORDER BY DESC(?v)
    }
   }
 }
 BIND (str(?x) as ?xName)
 BIND (strbefore(?ordered,?xName) as ?before) 
 BIND ((strlen(?before) / strlen(?xName)) + 1 as ?ranking)
} ORDER BY ?ranking
\end{lstlisting}

Anothre solution by Joshua Taylor would be:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=SPARQL]
SELECT ?x ?v (COUNT(*) as ?ranking) WHERE {
  ?x :value ?v .
  [] :value ?u .
  FILTER( ?v <= ?u )
}
GROUP BY ?x ?v
ORDER BY ?ranking
\end{lstlisting}
