computex
========

This project contains ontology and example files to statistical indexes.

The URI of the ontology is [this](http://purl.org/weso/ontology/computex)

We have developed an example file with some index data inspired from [The WebIndex](http://thewebindex.org) project.

We also developed a small Scala application which validates index data files and performs computations on them.
